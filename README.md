### ʜᴇʟʟᴏ, ᴡᴏʀʟᴅ! ɪᴛ's sᴏ ᴠᴇʀʏ ɴɪᴄᴇ ᴛᴏ ᴍᴇᴇᴛ ʏᴏᴜ.
My name is Jared, I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Oregon studying machine learning for use in network applications. I conduct research with the Oregon Network Research Group developing new ways of leveraging innovations in machine learning for use in making the network management more accessible and robust.

### ᴇᴅᴜᴄᴀᴛɪᴏɴ:
I completed my B.S. in Math, Computer Science, and Music Technology in Winter 2022 at the University of Oregon. I then joined the Ph.D. program in Computer Science (with an emphasis on Machine Learning) at the University of Oregon, where I remain to this day.

### ᴍʏ ɪɴᴛᴇʀᴇsᴛs:
I am passionate about both machine learning and data science, as well as music, art, and digital technologies. In my limited spare time, I enjoy tinkering with old electronics, building algorithmic soundscapes and music installations, designing and printing 3D sculptures, and building the [occasional silly website](https://j-red.github.io/vtt/).
