### ʜᴇʟʟᴏ, ᴡᴏʀʟᴅ!
My name is Jared, I'm a Software Engineer and Machine Learning Ph.D. student (currently on hiatus). I conduct research on identifying new ways of leveraging innovations in machine learning to make network management more accessible and robust. I also enjoy digital art and design, and am interested in creating technical art at the intersection of programming and artistic design.

Check out my site! https://j-red.github.io/

------------

### ᴇᴅᴜᴄᴀᴛɪᴏɴ:
I completed my B.S. in Math, Computer Science, and Music Technology in March 2022 and now work as a Software Engineer.

------------

### ᴍʏ ɪɴᴛᴇʀᴇsᴛs:
I am passionate about both machine learning and data science, as well as art, music, and digital technologies. In my limited spare time I enjoy tinkering with old electronics, developing algorithmic soundscapes, designing 3D sculptures, and building the [occasional silly website](https://j-red.github.io/vtt/).

Check out my 3D Demo Reel [here](https://j-red.github.io/demoreel/)!
